I am a widely skilled hardware and software designer in the St. Petersburg area. I have been working in the video game industry for the last 15 years. My most recent projects are related to a Unity(tm) game for the arcade redemption market, for which I wrote the game software and designed the I/O boards and arcade cabinet. This game is now going into production in China.

I can wear many hats at a development company: software designer and implementor, hardware circuit, PCB and manufacturing designer, mechanical designer, technical drawing and documentation author.

You're looking for me if:

- You have project vision but not the technical means to achieve it. I can do research and development, choose suitable tools and processes for all departments, and basically ensure that everything works.
- You wish to add to your team a "general specialist": someone with a wide spectrum of experience-based knowledge of software and hardware development and a particular interest in games.
- You are starting a new project or creating a new game development studio.

## SUMMARY

The job I'm looking for might be called "Technical Manager".
It would involve:
  - Assessing the technical requirements for implementing game designs.
  - Assessing available technologies for effectiveness and applicability. This involves knowing the company's in-house capabilities, and keeping track of new technologies that we might acquire or develop.
  - Forming realistic technical project completion plans.
  - Working with all teams to solve technical problems. Suggest solutions and designs where needed.
  - Working with leaders of all departments to ensure that plans and requirements are understood and reasonably scheduled.
