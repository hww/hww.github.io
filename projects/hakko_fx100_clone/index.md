# DIY Project for my workshop: Soldering Station

At my home workshop I have a Hakko FX-100 soldering station but I wish to have more advanced tool such as Metcal or Hakko FX100.  Those stations are expensive and that is why I decided to build a clone. I spent two days to assemble and test the boards. Now the electronic circuit works. The next step will be put them to aluminum case.

This image shows the micro-controller board based on PIC18.

This board is the RF power supply.  If you wish to build this project you can choose to assemble just this board.

Finally I decided to use it with the Hakko FX1001 iron and T31 tips with the new clone station. Mostly my decision is based on the price difference.

In case if you decide to build same board go to [EVBlog](http://www.eevblog.com/forum/projects/diy-metcal-13-56-mhz-rf-supply/)

# Heat Sink

Fixing the board to heatsink with four 5mm posts.
