# The hands tracking gloves

My task was to design and prototype a hands tracking gloves. The product should be low cost easy to produce and have a high precise of tracking.
I build four prototypes with differect type and quantity sensors, and different position of them on the hand. 

All prototypes shared same electronics circuit, wich includes:

- Power management and battery charger
- ESP32 microcontroller
- USB <-> Serial interface

The final specifications
