# DIY Project for my workshop: Soldering Station

At my home workshop I have a Hakko FX951 soldering station but I wish to have more advanced tool such as Metcal or Hakko FX100.  Those stations are expensive and that is why I decided to build a clone. I spent two days to assemble and test the boards. Now the electronic circuit works. The next step will be put them to aluminum case.

This image shows the micro-controller board based on PIC18.

This board is the RF power supply.  If you wish to build this project you can choose to assemble just this board.

Finally I decided to use it with the Hakko FX1001 iron and T31 tips with the new clone station. Mostly my decision is based on the price difference.
