# Magic Sound Board

I was lead designer of the MagicSound expansion board for Aleste 520EX computer. This board is very similar tothe sound system of the Amiga computer.

Features

- four DMA channel
- four programmable timers
- 8 bit per sample
- 6 bits of volume per channel
- 32kHz sample rate. 

With this board Aleste computer plays .stm (Scream Tracker) files. 

Photo below shows the recreated version of MagicSound board.
