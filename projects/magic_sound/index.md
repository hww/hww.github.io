# Magic Sound Board

I was lead designer of the MagicSound expansion board for Aleste 520EX computer. This board is very similar to sound system of Amiga computer.

**Features**

- four DMA channel
- four programmable timers
- 8 bit per sample
- 6 bits of volume per channel
- 32kHz sample rate. 

With this board Aleste computer plays .stm (Scream Tracker) files.
