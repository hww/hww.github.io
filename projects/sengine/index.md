# Game Engine Architect

I was lead developer of a game engine at Sybersoft in the mid-2000's.. 

The game engine had scene management, OpenGL rendering, animation and collision system, physics, audio and video player, a scripting language and a DSL for finite state machines. The engine also had a front-end GUI, providing a scene inspector, script editor and debugger.

We used Maya for level editing, and developed custom Maya tools for saving animation, mesh, materials and level designs in engine-ready formats.

Even though today I would do some parts of the design differently, this was very useful experience. After this project I see more pros and cons for various game engine design considerations.
