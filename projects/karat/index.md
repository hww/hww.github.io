# Instant Replay

I designed the plastic housing for a Nintendo Famicom (Japanese market version of NES) game cheat code device.
The housing was designed to meet Nintendo's specification for shell dimensions and PCB card connector position. SolidWorks was used for this task, along with their plastic molding design module.
(I also provided a circuit enhancement for the cheat code device that added compatibility for some extra game titles, because why not?)
