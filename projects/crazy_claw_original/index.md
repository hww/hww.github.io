# Crazy Claw Original

This was the first game developed for RocketAmusements ticket redemption and merchandiser game cabinet.

The system was three years in development including cabinet, multi-game framework and Crazy Claw Original game, with extensive field test.

The software runs on a normal PC for game applications with Rocket OS, a Linux environment providing common I/O, settings, networking and bookkeeping. 

**My responsibilities:**
