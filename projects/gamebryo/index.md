Using a LISP type language in game development allows easy implementation of DSL's, along with simple headache-free representations for code, script and data definitions.               
While evaluating Gamebryo for our team, I implemented a compete binding of GambitC Scheme to the Gamebryo engine. Creating this binding was fun, and provided valuable knowledge and experience with Lisp enhancments for game engines. The source code was mixed C++ and GambitC; the picture below shows an example.
