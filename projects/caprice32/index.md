## Aleste 520EX support for Caprice32

To allow running Aleste software on PC, I built a 520EX emulator based on the existing Caprice32 CP128 emulator. The work consisted of modifying some parts of the CP128 emulator and adding new modules with emulations for the 520EX's additional capabilities. A simulator for the MagicSound board was also incorporated.
