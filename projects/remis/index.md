# Digital Signal Processing & Sound Synthesizing
  
As lead developer I complete several project when worked for Remis Labs. 

The first project was a sound sythesizer with digital signal processor based on Altera FLEX 10K programmable logic device. Zilog Z80 was a main central processing unit, and Zilog Z8 as keybord controller.
