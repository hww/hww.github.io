# Digital Signal Processing & Sound Synthesizing
  
I completed several project while working for Remis Labs as Lead Developer. 

The first project was a sound sythesizer with digital signal processor based on Altera FLEX 10K programmable logic device. The main CPU was a Zilog Z80 and a Zilog Z8 was used as the keyboard controller.

The second project was a mini game for the Nintendo N64 console. To develop and test this game, a Nintendo ROM emulator known as PVBackup was developed. Finally, a custom N64 cartridge for the game was designed.

For the last task at Remis Labs, I created a sound synthesizer based on Motorola fixed point digital signal processor. Implemented in the C language, the result was a complete MIDI compatible multivoice sampling synthesizer.

Additionally, I created a command line tool to define and build sound banks for this synthesizer (also for N64 software development kit).
