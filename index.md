### Welcome to my portfolio

[hww](/pp/pp_hww_08.jpg)

I am a broadly skilled hardware and software designer in the St. Petersburg area, and have worked in the game industry for the last 15 years. My most recent project was a Unity game for the arcade redemption market, for which I wrote the game software and designed the I/O boards and arcade cabinet. This game is now going into production in China.
